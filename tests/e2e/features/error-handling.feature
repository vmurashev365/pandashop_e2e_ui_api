Feature: Error Handling and Edge Cases
  As a robust application
  I want to handle errors gracefully
  So that users have good experience even when things go wrong

  Background:
    Given I am testing error scenarios safely
    And real transactions are prevented
    And error recovery mechanisms are in place

  @e2e @error-handling @network @safe
  Scenario: Network connectivity issues
    Given I simulate network interruptions
    When network connection is lost temporarily
    Then application should show appropriate error message
    And retry mechanisms should work correctly
    And no data corruption should occur
    And user should be guided to retry

  @e2e @error-handling @slow-connection @safe
  Scenario: Slow network conditions
    Given I simulate slow network connection
    When pages load slowly
    Then loading indicators should be displayed
    And timeouts should be handled gracefully
    And user experience should remain acceptable
    And no broken states should occur

  @e2e @error-handling @invalid-data @safe
  Scenario: Invalid product data handling
    Given some products have missing or invalid data
    When I browse products with data issues
    Then error fallbacks should display correctly
    And application should not crash
    And user should see meaningful error messages
    And navigation should remain functional

  @e2e @error-handling @popup-issues @safe
  Scenario: Popup handling failures
    Given popups may appear unexpectedly
    When popup handling mechanisms are tested
    Then all popup types should be handled correctly
    And fallback mechanisms should work
    And user workflow should not be interrupted
    And multiple popups should be managed properly

  @e2e @edge-cases @empty-cart @safe
  Scenario: Empty cart edge cases
    Given cart is empty
    When I try to access cart functionality
    Then appropriate empty state should be shown
    And user should be guided to add products
    And no JavaScript errors should occur
    And navigation should remain available

  @e2e @edge-cases @large-cart @safe
  Scenario: Large quantity cart scenarios
    Given I try to add large quantities to cart
    When quantities exceed reasonable limits
    Then appropriate validation should occur
    And user should see quantity limit messages
    And system should handle large numbers gracefully
    And no overflow errors should occur
